    title: "Radiculopathy Physiotherapy Treatment",
    fullContent: "Effective Radiculopathy Treatment includes physical therapy for pain relief, strengthening, and mobility restoration. With personalized care, you can reduce symptoms and regain your freedom of movement. Radiculopathy, commonly known as a pinched nerve, occurs when a nerve root in the spinal column becomes compressed or inflamed. This pressure can lead to a range of symptoms, including sharp pain, numbness, tingling, or muscle weakness that radiates from the spine into the arms or legs. These symptoms can disrupt daily life, but the good news is that a variety of effective radiculopathy treatment options are available. This article explains the different types of radiculopathy, the diagnostic process, and the role of physiotherapy in providing lasting relief and restoring function.",
